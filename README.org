Cereal is a simple terminal-based text editor that is originally an implementation of [[https://github.com/antirez/kilo][Kilo]], with some additional features.
* Why Writing a Text Editor?
  February 2019, I was introduced into EMACS, a 40+ year-old text editor that is still as alive as ever. EMACS is something I never experience before, I began to play around with the configurations and eventually created my [[https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d][own]]. I never realize configuring an editor can be so much fun. I began to think about creating a text editor myself, this is when I encountered Kilo. I believe writing a tool as fundamental as a text editor is not only interesting and refreshing, it is also a source of inspiration, something I believe will be very useful in long-term.
