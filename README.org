* Why Writing a Text Editor?
  February 2019, I was introduced into EMACS, a 40+ year-old text editor that is still as alive as ever. I played around with the configurations and eventually created my own - [[https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d][M-EMACS]]. I began to think about writing a text editor myself. I believe creating a tool as fundamental as a text editor from scratch is not only interesting, it's also a refreshing source of inspiration and a precious experience.
* Ideas
** TODO Implement Language Server Protocol
